# Photoframe-design
I created a stylish photo frame using HTML5 and CSS3 for a frontend design project.The photo inside the frame, defined by an img tag, utilizes background-size: cover and background position center to ensure it fills the frame without distortion. This setup ensures a visually appealing presentation of the photo while maintaining responsive design principles.
